1. Loop through the array using the forEach() method to alert each item
   including the index number, e.g. '0 - apple' '1 - orange' etc.

2. Create a new array using the relevant iterator method that takes the
   fruits and sets them to uppercase.

3. Use the right iterator method to check to see if each fruit contains more
   than three letters, console log the boolean result.
