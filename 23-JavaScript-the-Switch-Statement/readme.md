1. Create a variable called favFood and set this equal to your fav food. Create a switch statement with four foods as cases, and another one that matches favFood, so we're looking for five cases in total. For each case log "That's right! [favFood] is my favourite!" Think about how to pull the favFood variable in. Finally add a default case that says "Fav food not found...I'm hungry".
