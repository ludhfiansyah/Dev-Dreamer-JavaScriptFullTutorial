# THE JS TERNARY OPERATOR

The Ternary Operator provides us with an easier way to write an if else statement. The word ternary means 'composed of three parts'

# TASK

1. Re-write the following if else statement as a Ternary Operator:

   let message = '';

   if (1 > 10) {
   message = 'Condition is TRUE'
   } else {
   message = 'Condition is FALSE'
   }

2. Assign the value '12:00' to a variable called time, and create a
   Ternary Operator to console log 'Good Morning' or 'Good Evening' depending
   on the time.
