### WHAT IS JS CONTROL FLOW?

By default our JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom, line by line however we can change this with Control Flow. Control flow allows our program to make decisions about what code is executed and when.

### CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS

Conditional Statements are basically checks tosee if a certain condition is either true or false. If the condition is true then run code A, if it's false then run code B.

### JAVASCRIPT LOOPS

Loops allow us to perform repetitive tasks with less code. For example using loops we can iterate over an array and perform some sort of action on each piece of data in the array, or we can use a loop to compile a list of all the items.
